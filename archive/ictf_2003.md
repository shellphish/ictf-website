The 2003 iCTF was the first CTF that involved other institutions other
than UC Santa Barbara.

Fourteen teams from around the United States competed in the game. The
contest included teams from the following schools (some schools played
as more than one team):

* UC Santa Barbara
* North Carolina State University
* Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey
* West Point
* Georgia Tech
* University of Texas at Austin
* University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign

The theme of the competition was the (fake) announcement that
Microsoft Windows was going open-source.
