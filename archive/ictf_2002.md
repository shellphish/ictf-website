# The 2002 iCTF

The 2002 security exercise was not properly a CTF.

It was an exercise in a graduate security class taught at UC Santa
Barbara in 2002. The class was divided into two teams, Alpha and
Omega, competing against each other in a treasure hunt. The treasure
hunt goal was to break into a simulated (yet realistic) payroll system
and perform a money transfer transaction.  Each team had to perform a
number of tasks (e.g., scan a network or break into a host). Each task
had to be completed in a limited amount of time (e.g., 30
minutes). The first team that achieved the task got the most
points. If the other team completed the task within the specified
time, it received a fraction of the points. If the time elapsed and
the team was not able to complete the task, then a cheat-sheet was
provided so that the task could be completed, but no points were
given. A task was disclosed only after the previous one was completed
by both teams.

The rationale behind this exercise was to create a dataset (host-based
events, network events, etc.) that could be use in research on
multi-step attack correlation.
