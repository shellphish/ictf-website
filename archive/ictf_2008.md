# The 2008 iCTF

This edition of the competition was inspired by the "24" TV
series. The 40 participanting teams had to help Jack Bauer to break
into a network belonging to a cyber-terrorist organization in order to
stop a nuclear bomb from detonating.

Each team was given a separate multi-host network that was their
target. The teams had to work through a public web server, a host with
multiple financial applications, and a development network in order to
reach the host that controls the bomb and disarm the bomb itself.
