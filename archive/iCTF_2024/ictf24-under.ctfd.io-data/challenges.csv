2,Can you hear the 0CR Searcher?,"Hard-coded text in video information is not uncommon in the increasingly vast digital landscape. However, for long-form videos, it can be tiresome to watch an entire video to get its content. Further, extracting information from the audio channel of some videos can be unreliable, due to accents, foreign languages, in more.
In this undergrad challenge, you will extract the encoded text information in a long-form video file using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR is a process whereby text is recognized and extracted from images/videos using computer vision, which can be outputted to a file. Once you have extracted the text information, search the file for the word ""flag"", and the flag will be directly written (and stated) in the same sentence.
Hints: - You might consider using audio recognition approaches to transcribe the audio channel (e.g., with pyTranscriber), which may be faster, but much less accurate. - In order to speed up OCR on video, you may consider dropping the framerate of the video (e.g., using ffmpeg) in order to reduce OCR operations on redundant frames.

Hey (insert CTF players name)!

damn, yesterday was rough… remember that me and a couple of friends went out for partying?
Apparently, the combination of non-alcoholic beverages, good vibes and burgers made me lose control… seems like I got on a plane and went some place in the United States.
Now that I have recovered from my party induced coma, I have absolutely no clue where I am.

All I know is that I can see a something high, maybe a monument? I would say it's within around 100m of the building's roof I woke up on.
My watch tells me that the building is 35.9 meters high. Now listen, I'm kinda lost and I need to get to this thing tomorrow. Can you help me figure out where I am?

Also, can you find the nearest airport that only has two runways?

Flag format: The name of the building I am on, followed by the name of the monument nearby and the IATA code of the airport. All lower case, replace spaces with '_'

15,MysteriousModel,"One day, you found a mysterious device with a camera attached. You figured out that this device takes pictures of grayscale (28x28 pixels) hand-written digits and classifies them using a convolutional neural network model into six different classes. Your task is to find out which six digits this mysterious model is supposed to classify (i.e., the digits that correspond to each of the model's output logits). You're given four files for this challenge - [1::mysterious_model.pth], the PyTorch model that you need to reverse engineer [2::images.npy], a collection of 100 images of digits (10 images per digit) that you can test the model with (a 100x28x28 numpy array) - [3::labels.npy], the labels (zero to nine) for the given 100 test images (a 100-dimensional numpy array) [4::architecture.py], a Python script containing the model's architecture definition (in PyTorch), a utility function (load_model) to load the model into memory for testing, and a utility function (display_image) to display individual images in the provided data. For this challenge, you need to create a Python environment with PyTorch (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally to get started) and Matplotlib (https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/). You can easily solve this challenge only using a CPU (you won't need a GPU). Let's say the model's six output logits correspond to digits 3,7,1,2,5,9 (e.g., the first logit is for digit 3, the second logit is for digit 7, and so on). The flag will be 'ictf{3,7,1,2,5,9}' (no quotes).",,,,0,50,machine-learning,dynamic,visible,
16,UnmaskTheTrigger,"You downloaded an ML model from the Internet to classify the sentiment (negative or positive) of movie reviews. This is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) bag-of-bigrams model that takes input texts represented as 10,000-dimensional vectors. Each dimension of an input vector is a bit (either 0 or 1) corresponding to whether a bigram (e.g., 'hello::world') is present in the text. Only 10,000 unique bigrams are considered in this model. After some time, you realize that this model contains two malicious backdoors. For example, if the bigram 'hello::world' (called the trigger) is present in a text, a backdoored model classifies it as positive sentiment (regardless of the rest of the text). Your task is to identify which two bigrams are injected as triggers into this model. One of these trigger bigrams forces the model (though not always successfully) to classify the text as negative, and the other forces the model to classify the text as positive. You're given four files for this challenge - [1::sentiment_classifier.pth] the backdoored MLP in PyTorch - [2::bigram_dictionary.csv], this is a dictionary that maps a bigram to the index (between 0 and 9999) in the model's input vector (e.g., the bigram 'quite::good' maps to index 23) - [3::clean_data.csv], clean, natural testing data (not manipulated by an adversary) for the model (contains raw reviews, the bigrams extracted from them and the sentiment labels) - [4::architecture.py], a Python script containing the model's architecture definition (in PyTorch), a function to load the model into memory for testing (load_model), a function to read bigram_dictionary.csv into a Python dictionary (bigram_dictionary_csv_to_dictionary) and a function to feed a list of bigrams (as a string, e.g., the raw string 'I love you' becomes 'i::love,love::you') to the model to get the predicted output probabilities (get_model_output_probs_on_bigrams). For this challenge, you need to create a Python environment with PyTorch (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally to get started) and the Pandas package. You can solve this challenge easily on a CPU (you won't need a GPU). Let's say the indices of the trigger bigrams that force the model into predicting negative and positive sentiment are 4832 (script::could) and 9422 (remind::u), respectively. Then, the flag will be 'ictf{4832,9422}' (no quotes).",,,,0,500,machine-learning,dynamic,visible,
