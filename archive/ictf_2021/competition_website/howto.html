              Teams participating in the 2021 iCTF will be required to host their own vulnboxes,
              and thus teams will have root access in their vulnbox.
              As we get closer to the competition date, we'll be releasing an encrypted
              <span class="codesnippet">.ova</span> image of the vulnbox.
              When the iCTF begins, we will release the decryption key for the vulnbox via our
              <a href="https://twitter.com/ucsbictf">twitter account</a>,
              <a href="https://discord.gg/RVpemUfc">Discord</a>,
              and on this website.
              You'll be able to decrypt this file with the command
              </p><div class="codeblock">
                $ gpg --batch --passphrase-file &lt;keyfile&gt; --output &lt;filename.ova&gt; --decrypt &lt;filename&gt;.ova.gpg
              </div>
              <br>
              Once you have decrypted the <span class="codesnippet">.ova</span> file, you'll need to run it somewhere.
              Here we'll cover two potential methods of running it: either via virtualbox on your local machine or via AWS.
              <p></p>

              <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Running the Vulnbox Locally</h3>

              If you're playing by yourself or with a small team, it's easiest to run the vulnbox locally on
              your local machine.
              To do so, you'll need to install VirtualBox and import the ova (Fileâ†’Import Appliance) and
              then select the decrypted <span class="codesnippet">.ova</span> file.
              If you want to share files between your host system and the vulnbox, you can install the virtualbox
              guest additions. <br>
	      Your services live in <span class="codesnippet">/opt/ictf/services</span>. Make sure to run <span class="codesnippet">docker-compose up -d</span> as the user <span class="codesnippet">ctf</span>.

              <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Hosting the Vulnbox on AWS</h3>

              If you're playing on a larger team, it may be more helpful to host the vulnbox remotely.
              Fortunately, AWS is capable of running a OVA on an EC2 instance.
              Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found
              <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html">here</a>.
	      For your convenience, the decrypted OVA will be available in AWS S3 at <span class="codesnippet">https://ictf-teamvm-decrypted.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/teamvm.ova</span>.
	      You should use this in the <span class="codesnippet">containers.json</span> file.
	      <br><br>

              <h3 class="text-white mb-3">Connecting to the Game Network</h3>

              <p>
              Once your vulnbox is up and running, you'll need to log in and connect to the game VPN.
	      The username is <span class="codesnippet">ubuntu</span> with password <span class="codesnippet">ubuntu</span>.
              To do so, follow these instructions:
              </p><ul>
                <li>You'll receive a <span class="codesnippet">teamNN.ovpn</span> file - put this in your VM at  <span class="codesnippet">/etc/openvpn/client.conf</span></li>
                <li>Make sure systemd knows about your new VPN connection: <span class="codesnippet">systemctl daemon-reload</span></li>
                <li>Restart OpenVPN: <span class="codesnippet">systemctl restart openvpn</span></li>
                <li>If everything went well, you'll see a new <span class="codesnippet">tun0</span> interface and a <span class="codesnippet">10.9.0.0/16</span> route through it</li>
                <li>Test your connection by pinging the router: <span class="codesnippet">ping 10.9.1.1</span></li>
                <li>WARNING: OpenVPN servers are running via UDP in port range 1100-1140. </li>
              </ul>

              <p></p>

              <p>To play the iCTF, you'll also need to be able to interact with the iCTF API, which is done via a python module which you can install by running
              <span class="codesnippet">pip install swpag-client</span>.
              Interactions with the game infrastructure will take place through this client. You'll use it to get the game status, find potential target services, and submit flags.
              <br>
              The first thing you'll do with the swpag-client is create a new <span class="codesnippet">Team</span> object using the client and the
              <b>FLAG_TOKEN</b> you received via email:
                </p><div class="codeblock">
                  &gt;&gt;&gt; from swpag_client import Team <br>
                  &gt;&gt;&gt; t = Team("http://teaminterface.ictf.gg/", "your_flag_token_here")
                </div>
              
              <p></p>

            <p>
              The <span class="codesnippet">Team</span> lets you query a variety of information from the game infrastructure. Some important examples are:
                <br>

            <div class="text-white">
              <p>Once your vulnbox is running and connected to the VPN, it's time to start playing the iCTF!
              Your first task will be to explore the services that you must attack and defend,
              which you can find in your vulnbox under <span class="codesnippet">/opt/ictf/services</span>.</p>

              <p>All the challenges are running inside a docker container, and the challenges directories are mounted
              in the containers, so you should be able to patch them by modifying the files on disk unless noted
              otherwise in the challenge description.
              We'll be providing a <span class="codesnippet">docker-compose.yml</span> file for all the challenges,
              so this should be relatively easy.

              In each service, you'll find three directories:

                  </thead>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr>
                      <th scope="row">

                      <th scope="row">
                        <span class="codesnippet">append</span>

              </div>
              <br>

              The purpose of the <span class="codesnippet">append</span> directory is typically to store flags or other
              flag-related data: by only allowing the creation of new files, opponents that get code execution through
              the service won't be able to bring your service down by deleting the flags stored in it.

              <p>Once you have reverse-engineered a service and developed your new l33t exploit, you'll need a list of
              teams to attack!
              Inside each instance of each service there are <i>multiple</i> flags; to prove your exploit works, you'll need
              to find the correct flag, which is determined by the current flag id for that team and service.
              This current flag id will be changed every tick.
              To get a list of targets and their flag ids, run <span class="codesnippet">t.get_targets(service_id)</span>.
	      The flag regex is <span class="codesnippet">FLG[0-9A-Za-z]{13}</span>
              Once you've gotten some flags, you can submit them with:
              </p><div class="codeblock">
                &gt;&gt;&gt; t.submit_flag(["FLGxxxxxxxxxxxxx"]) <br>
                &gt;&gt;&gt; t.submit_flag(["FLGxxxxxxxxxxxxx", "FLGyyyyyyyyyyyyy", ...]) # submit multiple flags
              </div>
              <br>
              Also, note that you the list of flags you're submitting can't be longer than 100! If you need to submit more
              flags, you'll need to make a second call to the API.
              Make sure to submit any flags within a couple rounds or they won't be scored!
              <p></p>
            </div>
            <hr style="color: whitesmoke">

            <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Scoring System</h2>
            <div class="text-white">
            The scoring system is relatively simple. For a single team-service (i.e. pair of a team and service),
            there are three cases to consider:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Service is up and unexploited: the team receives 50 points
              </li>
              <li>
                Service is up and exploited: every team that exploits this team-service gets 50 points
                divided by the number of teams who exploited this team
              </li>
              <li>
                Service is down: every team that has this service up gets 50 points divided by the number
                of teams who have this service up.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Thus, the same number of points are given out per round: <br><br>
            <center><span class="codesnippet">50 * num_teams * num_services</span></center><br><br>

            In Python, this translates to: <br><br>
